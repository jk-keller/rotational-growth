# Rotational Growth Photoshop Scripts

## How to

It’s generally good to have a canvas bigger than the image you want to alter. You’ll also probably want to save the file as `Large Document Format` (.psb) as the file size gets real big, real fast.

- Select a layer to apply the script to.
- Go to `File` menu, choose `Scripts`, then `Browse…` and select the file you want to use
- Sit back and wait 🍸
